leather armchairs clustered together in a corner of the room provide a place to peruse the books in

bridge's platform.  Silver Dragon Lane stretches down into Hong Fa just to the east as well, leading
off from the base of the bridge.  The wooden boardwalk continues to stretch off far to the east and
west, making it a leisurely stretch to stroll.  The boardwalk has a railing which prevents people
from jumping off it compulsively - well, the railing probably isn't the only thing that prevents
them from jumping.  They appear to be more afraid of Lord Hong's punishment for jumping than they
are of suicide.[39;49m[0m[0m

[0mThe rolling plateau which sits atop Tora Hill is crowned by a very tall and thin pagoda.  Owned by
the Fang Family, the pagoda is the crowning glory of their achievement, and a perfect attestment to
the reason why they remain one of the lesser families of importance in Bes Pelargic.  The pagoda,
lovely as it is, has had so many renovations to its facade that it looks like a sloppy work of
architecture done by the Agatean equivalent of Bloody Stupid Johnson.  The only thing that saves the
pagoda from being an entire write-off is the expansive flog course which encircles it and covers the
rest of the plateau.  A zigzagging staircase leads back down to the base of the hill just to the
south.[39;49m[0m[0m
