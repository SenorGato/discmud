09:38pm [0mYou tell Stamen den Garran: I'm just confused, the process isn't very clear.  Lets say I want a pishe ressurection rod as a sek priest[39;49m[0m[0m
09:39pm [0mYou ask Stamen den Garran: That would mean I would need to consecrate a rod to Sek, give it to a pishe, and they would charge it with ressurection?[39;49m[0m[0m
09:39pm [0mYou ask Stamen den Garran: or does it need to be consecrated to pishe first, and filled, then refilled again after I reconsecrate it to sek?[39;49m[0m[0m
09:40pm [0m[1;33mStamen den Garran tells you: Almost. The rod would be consecrated to Pishe, then Res bestowed into it. Then, it would need ot be fully charged by a Pishite priest (followers can't charge them). Once fully charged to 15/15 ("imprinted"), the Sekkite takes the rod and consecrates it to Sek. That resets the rit charge level to 1 ("inbued, barely visible light"), then it needs to be charged by a sekkite priest to at least 6/15 ("impressed"). At impressed level, you can perform the rit from it without the rit leaving the rod[39;49m[0m[39;49m[0m[0m

12:31am [0m[1;33mQuow Bell tells you: Yes - it was just never used/done, partly because it turns out so many rooms have changing descriptions (some change with season, some with time of day, some both, some with room-objects or players affecting the description, not to mention descriptions often get tweaked with typo changes, modifications etc.), and partly because liaisons also preferred them not to be stored.[39;49m[0m[39;49m[0m[0m

12:36am [0m[1;33mQuow Bell tells you: Your best bet by far and away would be to just set up a trigger that grabs text after [the room short line], and stops hiding/capturing after the "There are no obvious exits|There are (.+?) obvious exits?" type of trigger, so you capture everything (which would include ascii map and possible weather line when outdoors) between the short desc and the exit line.  You could even be smart and ignore lines not beginning with a capital letter (that'll skip most ascii map lines) and stop capturing after the first linebreak beyond that (so you won't capture weather etc.).[39;49m[0m[39;49m[0m[0m

05:13pm [0mYou ask BeastEater: Sure, on a 100gp ritual, it now only costs 95gp. BUT that 5Gp reduction requires you to pay 50GP for it later, since 10gp -> 1 DP pool right?[39;49m[0m[0m

05:30pm [0mYou tell BeastEater: It makes sense.  There is a world where if I'm burning the entire pool, if you turn on the penalty to 30% I will be forced to pay back my GP to the deity pool.  The wiki says its more efficent too.:D[39;49m[0m[0m
