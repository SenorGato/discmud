09:38pm [0mYou tell Stamen den Garran: I'm just confused, the process isn't very clear.  Lets say I want a pishe ressurection rod as a sek priest[39;49m[0m[0m
09:39pm [0mYou ask Stamen den Garran: That would mean I would need to consecrate a rod to Sek, give it to a pishe, and they would charge it with ressurection?[39;49m[0m[0m
09:39pm [0mYou ask Stamen den Garran: or does it need to be consecrated to pishe first, and filled, then refilled again after I reconsecrate it to sek?[39;49m[0m[0m
09:40pm [0m[1;33mStamen den Garran tells you: Almost. The rod would be consecrated to Pishe, then Res bestowed into it. Then, it would need ot be fully charged by a Pishite priest (followers can't charge them). Once fully charged to 15/15 ("imprinted"), the Sekkite takes the rod and consecrates it to Sek. That resets the rit charge level to 1 ("inbued, barely visible light"), then it needs to be charged by a sekkite priest to at least 6/15 ("impressed"). At impressed level, you can perform the rit from it without the rit leaving the rod[39;49m[0m[39;49m[0m[0m
