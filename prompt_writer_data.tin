Oddly enough, though, "Wellcome to Ankh-Morporke" doesn't mention the bloodstains on the door, the numerous axe notches, or the lingering aroma of bad ale.  A nearby sign has been provided outside the Drum to aid the numerous drunken revellers who accumulate during the night, though how effectively is questionable.  A sturdy door leads north into the pub (if you dare), to the south is Short Street and Filigree Street runs east-west.[39;49m[0m[0m
