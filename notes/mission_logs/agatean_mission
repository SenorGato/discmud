Agatean Missions:
Hatayagainoro whispers to you: Success in this mission will help your    
standing with Lord Tang; he will be watching with interest.  The     
greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are       
treated.  Well it's time our enemies' greatness was put to the       
test.  Full details are on this chit.                                
You will need this cage in order to complete the mission.  Deposit   
the cage here when you are done.  Should you lose your chit please   
ask me for a replacement.
