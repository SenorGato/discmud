Instead of trying to maintain state.  Lets just call the purge function on every write.
It currently purges stale jobs, but we can write more complex logic
Inlcuding different times for different jobs and... job types.
So there should never in the database be a case where there are 2 unfinished jobs of the same type.
Then when we reference the element in t he table we don't have to do it by it
We instead do it by job type && NULL because there should only ever be one field meeting those critera.
