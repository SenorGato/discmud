Ingest_Timers Table
Trigger when completed_on TRUE
Move to timers table
Calculate timer completion time from Mission type + Constants table
Constants table holds mission type cooldowns
We need a function when the timer_completion_time has expried
Move to cold storage

Ingest <- Name/Started-on/Completed-on/xp/money
Missions <- Ingest
Timers <- Ingest Name/Background Worker
Constants <- Job Definitions

We are going to lifecycle hook onto row updates for completed_on so that 
when completed_on is defined it:
migrates the row to missions table
instantiates timer on timers table

Write background worker to create new timer row with auto explosion
