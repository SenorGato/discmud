19:11 < senoraraton> I think how I did it before was to created the database manually, set ownership, then login as 
                     discmud and execute the script, but I was trying to "automate" the entire process without the 
                     manual creation
19:12 < RhodiumToad> you can change user within the script
19:12 -!- shokohsc5 [~shokohsc@37.170.138.141] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
19:12 -!- shokohsc58 is now known as shokohsc5
19:12 < RhodiumToad> (either using \c or SET ROLE)
19:12 < peerce> database permissions are CONNECT and CREATE.   schema permissions are USAGTE and CREATE
19:13 < RhodiumToad> CONNECT, CREATE and TEMP for databases
19:13 < peerce> CREATE DATABASE dbname OWNER ownername;     is a good way to start, then connect to the database as 
                that owner, and do everything else
